**Job application email by an experienced professional**+

Dear Ms. Anjana Dikshit,

This is regarding the job advertisement you placed on Naukri for Associate Software Engineer MEAN. I have read the job description and requirements carefully and I think I might be a good fit for this position.

I graduated with a B.B.A. in Human Resource Manager. I am well-versed in MERN Full Stack Development including ReactJS, NodeJS, ExpressJS, MongoDB, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, jQuery, C++ and C have basic programming experience working on Internship and my personal projects. 

I also have a good knowledge of some tools like Git and GitHub, operating systems, email systems and Microsoft Visual Studio Code. I am quick at learning new software and technologies and can follow instructions and work well with a team.



You can check out one project that I programmed on my website, AnjaliMCoder.com. I am attaching my cover letter and CV with this email.

I hope to hear from you soon.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

Nirnjan Patel
